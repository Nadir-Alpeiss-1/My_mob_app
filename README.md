# Welcome to My Mobapp Studio
***

## Task
My task was to analyze and to create some drawings for the data analyzed, i.e. mob apps downloaded from google play. The main challenge was to arrange everything in a way, so everything can be seen in the pie charts since there were tiny parts of pies. 

## Description
To solve the problem I used google a lot, especially when i came to the drawings part. To see all the parameters of plots, their colors, positions etc. It is time consuming taks, but very useful since drawings are easier to understand.

## Installation
One need to enter in the console the following: "jypyter notebook --no-browser" (without commas), then copy the link and open a new one adding "web-" just after https://. Then enter "qwasar" (without commas) as a password. Choose my_mobapp_studio file and then just press play button seveal times, so you can see that code works. 

## Usage
Pressing play button will enable jupyter notebook to run the code, so that everything is seen for a user. In addition all the drawings are available if you go to the link shown in the link_to_blog_post file.

### The Core Team
I solved this problem by myself, since there were noone at the moment who wanted to solve it. For not wasting my time I closed the group and started doing it by myself.
